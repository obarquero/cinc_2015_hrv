\section{Conclusions}

The performance of nonlinear HRV indices during and after high intensity exercise suggests that they could be assessing relevant information about underlying physiological recovery. In this context, information provided by HRR may not be enough to evaluate the complex mechanisms behind these physiological changes. Therefore, HRV nonlinear indices should be also taken into account to assess physical condition or cardiovascular risk. In this study, HRVR did not correlate with HRR for any of the selected nonlinear indices, which reinforces the idea of these indices providing complementary information to HRR.
